# Frontend Mentor | advice generator solution

This is a solution to the advice generator. The challenge is from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX/hub/tip-calculator-app-pYjUN5jinc).


## Challenge consists of


1. View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
1. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
1. Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person


## What I learned

Complete challenge, I decided to build the app in different ways, in the `js/src/` folder, I tried axios, fetch, async await + fetch, XMLHTTPRequest. And with TypeScript, I'm currently practicing a bit of TypeScript, and this really challenged me and was very helpful for creating interfaces and using static typing with asyn and await.

## Technologies used in the project

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Axios
